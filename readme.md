1. [Sign up for Parse](https://www.parse.com/signup)
2. Create a new parse app
3. Add at least 1 class to your parse app
4. Manually add some data
5. Create a new app that uses Backbone models and collections to fetch the data from parse and put it on the screen

__Note:__ as long as data is being fetched from parse via Backbone and displayed an the screen you are free to do whatever else.

Have fun with it.
